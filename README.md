# NumPy Basics

This repository contains my notes and practice exercises covering the fundamentals of NumPy. I learned these concepts primarily from the Google for Developers YouTube video on NumPy.

## What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.  It's a foundational library for scientific computing in Python.

## Topics Covered

This repo covers the following basic NumPy concepts:

* **Creating Arrays:**  Different ways to create NumPy arrays (e.g., from lists, using `arange`, `zeros`, `ones`, `linspace`).
* **Array Attributes:** Understanding array properties like `ndim` (number of dimensions), `shape` (dimensions of the array), `size` (total number of elements), and `dtype` (data type of elements).
* **Array Indexing and Slicing:** Accessing individual elements and sub-arrays using various indexing and slicing techniques.
* **Array Operations:** Performing element-wise mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) on NumPy arrays.
* **Reshaping Arrays:** Changing the dimensions of arrays using functions like `reshape` and `flatten`.
* **Broadcasting:** Understanding how NumPy handles operations on arrays of different shapes. 
* **Basic Linear Algebra:** A brief introduction to linear algebra operations with NumPy (e.g., matrix multiplication using `@` or `np.dot`).

## How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AkibDa/NumPY.git` (Replace with your actual repo URL)
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd NumPY`
3. The code examples and exercises are in main.py. You can run them using a Python environment with NumPy installed.
